## On May 12th 2018, Bitcoinfive.com stole 0.0254 BTC from me, claiming to be following "anti-money laundering laws". _I'd like to get my money back._

### For the record, I rate the site 0/5 stars. ###

I had recently decided to cash out some of my BTC, and after searching through potential websites (Coinbase restricted my account for no specific reason), I came across Bitcoinfive.com.
The design of the site looks professional, and although the pictures used for the people writing testimonials look like stock photos, I didn't think much of it.
Because I wanted to cash out my Bitcoin! I was blinded by the idea that I could get money in my PayPal fast! 

### What made the site look legit
I figured that the chance of it being a scam was low, consdiering how the company who owns Bitcoinfive.com is listed in the UK's Companies House, which is a directory of companies that have been registered in the UK. Their site has an SSL certificate, they list their "address" and "phone number" on their site (the phone number was disconnected last time I called, hence the quotation marks), and in the form you fill out to sell BTC, they even have a place where you are supposed to put a "return BTC address", which really added to their credability for me. 
However, there were a nuumber of warning signs that BitcoinFive may not be trust worthy that I didn't really take seriously.

### The warnings
#### The company behind BitcoinFive was dissolved in April
If you look at the bottom of BitcoinFive.com, you'll see the name "GX MONEY CAPITAL LTD". This is the company that apparently runs the site.
Or, at least, used to. Not because the site has changed hands or anything, but because GX Money Capital doesn't exist anymore.
According to the previously mentioned Companies House site, "GX MONEY CAPITAL LTD (Company number 10479958)" was dissolved on April 24th, after being in buisness since 2016.
One thing I found intresting about the Companies House listing is that the only name mentioned in the Companies registration is a "LACZO, Janos". Whenever I recieved an email from BitcoinFive, each email would be signed by a different person, like "Khaled Biyari (CFC, Risk Management, GX Money Capital LTD)" for example. A quick Google search yeilds no information about "Khaled Biyari" or "Janos Laczo", and I would expect some what of a SEO presence for someone who is involved in the cryptocurrency/technology industry.
Not to mention the fact that none of the people seemingly composing BCF's emails are mentioned in the Companies House listing.
#### Online reviews are suspect
One of the first things you see when you Google search "BitcoinFive.com" is a listing from an online review site that boosts the amazing rating of 4.5 stars.
Once I actually read into these reviews, I realized something weird-- Reviews were either "This site is amazing, 5 stars" or "This site is a scam, 1 star". Even on sites that I've used the exchange BTC for USD, that are real and everything, often don't have 5 star reviews. Often you'd see something like "Transaction took 2 hours, 3 stars", as companies aren't perfect-- mistakes can be made. But BCF's reviews are either black or white, no inbetween.
What makes it even weirder is that the positive reviews I found were writen in rather poor english-- one specific 5 star review I found on trustpilot.com read: "[Sic]My experience has been really great! The service works quickly and the way one would expect it. When I ran into problems one time (my fault!), the team helped me and provided me with good alternatives. I enjoy doing business with them. Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Highly recommended!" That's not a typo on my part, "Highly recommended" was repeated 9 times in the review. Doesn't seem very creditable to me, how about you?
#### Any review I found from an actual person (with an internet presence and such) was negative and went the same way
Here's basically what people say would happen (this is what happened to me as well):
-You sen in your Bitcoin
-You get an order confirmation
-You get an email saying your order has been flagged, that you need to send in an ID, a picture of you with your ID, and a document that confirms your address. The message also mentions that you should send this info with in 72 hours.
-You send in the needed documents
-They said they can't except the sent documents and ask you to try again
-This repeats for 72 hours, then they stop replying to your messages, and keep your Bitcoin
Looking at some review sites online will yeild lots of these stories, and this is indeed what happened to me.
#### What should I do if I get scammed?
First thing I did was report it to the UK Action Fraud website, since GX Money Capital appears to be based in the UK. Next thing I did was make this website. 
Because Bitcoin isn't really accepted as an actual curreny by many goverments, there is little procedure to help those who have their Bitcoin stolen away. So, if Bitcoinfive has done this to you, I'd invite you to create your own site, or to upload a video onto YouTube sharing your negative experience. Best case senario at this point is to warn the public about this site and sites like it.

### Note: This is what happened to me. My intention is not to defame anyone/any company in a false/liablous manner. I am simply telling my experience, and I will continue to update this page if I do get a refund at some point, although based off my current experience I don't think a refund is going to happen. If you work at BitcoinFive and think that this was just a misunderstanding, and would like to correct this whole experience and refund me my money, you can send 0.0254 BTC to 1BYMtJ75Hbz5CQFGgA49ebQKc3tiX7PvCR.
